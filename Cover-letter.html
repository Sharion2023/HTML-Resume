          Dear Hiring Manager, <br />As a registered respiratory therapist
          turned software developer, I bring a unique combination of analytical
          thinking, precision, and compassion to every project I take on. After
          years of caring for patients in fast-paced healthcare environments, I
          discovered a passion for problem-solving through technology — leading
          me to complete intensive training in full-stack web development.
          Today, I’m eager to apply both my clinical discipline and new
          technical expertise to build software that makes a real difference.
          Through my training in Java, JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and SQL,
          I’ve developed projects that reflect both strong logic and
          user-focused design. I especially enjoy translating complex problems
          into clean, efficient code — a skill honed from years of making quick,
          high-stakes decisions in critical care settings. My background in
          healthcare has also instilled an exceptional attention to detail,
          collaboration under pressure, and empathy for end users — all traits
          that align perfectly with thoughtful, human-centered development. I’m
          particularly drawn to [Company Name] because of your commitment to
          [something specific about the company—innovation, patient care
          technology, user experience, etc.]. I’m confident my blend of clinical
          insight and technical proficiency would allow me to contribute
          meaningfully to your team’s mission of creating solutions that improve
          lives. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my journey from
          healthcare to software can bring a unique perspective to your
          development team. Thank you for your time and consideration — I look
          forward to connecting with you soon. <br />Warm regards, <br />
          <strong>Sharion Cranston</strong>
